## Problem

This Python script is used to analyse the pharmacy data to generate a list of drugs, the total number of UNIQUE individials who prescribed the medication, and the total drug cost, which must be listed in descending order.

Insight DataScience asked to tackle this challenge without using the libraries. Thats a challenge if we are used to have libraries in our daily usage. However, to test the knowledge of basics of Python, this is a good start.
